# Task 1: Stock Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective:
The goal of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical stock data for three companies: Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard (BND), and SPDR (SPY). We focus on understanding trends, calculating returns, and examining statistical properties to identify insights into their performance from 2015 to 2024.
Description:

In this task, we have successfully loaded and analyzed stock data for the three companies, performing several key actions:

    Data Loading and Cleaning
        Stock data for Tesla, Vanguard, and SPDR was fetched from a reliable source and cleaned for missing values and inconsistencies. The dataset covers stock prices from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024.

    Data Visualization
        We plotted the stock price trends over time for each company to visualize the growth and fluctuations. This gives a clear sense of how the stock prices of these companies have evolved in the last decade.
        Additionally, we visualized the daily returns for each company to assess the volatility and patterns in the stock's price movements.

    Return Calculations
        We calculated the daily, weekly, and monthly returns for each company, which reflect the changes in stock prices over different periods.
        These returns were used to assess how much each stock has gained or lost during specific intervals and to measure their volatility.

    Statistical Analysis
        Key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and correlation between the companies' stock prices were computed. These help in understanding the central tendency, variability, and relationship between different stocks.
        We also checked for trends, seasonality, and stationarity through statistical tests, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Steps:

    Load and Clean Data
        Download stock data (2015â€“2024) for Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard (BND), and SPDR (SPY).
        Clean data by handling missing values and data inconsistencies.

    Data Visualization
        Plot stock price trends over time for each company.
        Visualize daily returns to identify volatility and price patterns.

    Calculate Returns
        Calculate daily, weekly, and monthly returns.
        Compute average returns and volatility for each stock.

    Statistical Analysis
        Analyze key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
        Perform tests for trends, seasonality, and stationarity.

## Expected Outputs:

    Time series plots showing stock prices over the analyzed period.
    Visualizations of daily, weekly, and monthly returns.
    Statistical analysis results, including mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
    Insights into volatility, trends, and market behavior based on the data.
