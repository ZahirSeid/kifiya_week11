# Task 1: Stock Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective:
The goal of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical stock data for three companies: Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard (BND), and SPDR (SPY). We focus on understanding trends, calculating returns, and examining statistical properties to identify insights into their performance from 2015 to 2024.
Description:

In this task, we have successfully loaded and analyzed stock data for the three companies, performing several key actions:

    Data Loading and Cleaning
        Stock data for Tesla, Vanguard, and SPDR was fetched from a reliable source and cleaned for missing values and inconsistencies. The dataset covers stock prices from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024.

    Data Visualization
        We plotted the stock price trends over time for each company to visualize the growth and fluctuations. This gives a clear sense of how the stock prices of these companies have evolved in the last decade.
        Additionally, we visualized the daily returns for each company to assess the volatility and patterns in the stock's price movements.

    Return Calculations
        We calculated the daily, weekly, and monthly returns for each company, which reflect the changes in stock prices over different periods.
        These returns were used to assess how much each stock has gained or lost during specific intervals and to measure their volatility.

    Statistical Analysis
        Key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and correlation between the companies' stock prices were computed. These help in understanding the central tendency, variability, and relationship between different stocks.
        We also checked for trends, seasonality, and stationarity through statistical tests, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Steps:

    Load and Clean Data
        Download stock data (2015â€“2024) for Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard (BND), and SPDR (SPY).
        Clean data by handling missing values and data inconsistencies.

    Data Visualization
        Plot stock price trends over time for each company.
        Visualize daily returns to identify volatility and price patterns.

    Calculate Returns
        Calculate daily, weekly, and monthly returns.
        Compute average returns and volatility for each stock.

    Statistical Analysis
        Analyze key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
        Perform tests for trends, seasonality, and stationarity.

## Expected Outputs:

    Time series plots showing stock prices over the analyzed period.
    Visualizations of daily, weekly, and monthly returns.
    Statistical analysis results, including mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
    Insights into volatility, trends, and market behavior based on the data.

# Task2

This task is designed to analyze the market trends of three major financial assets: TSLA (Tesla), SPY (S&P 500 ETF), and BND (Bond ETF). The analysis leverages machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to forecast the future prices of these assets based on historical data.

The task includes several key steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Preparing and cleaning historical data for the assets.
    Model Training and Forecasting: Using pre-trained LSTM models to generate price forecasts.
    Market Trend Analysis: Analyzing trends, volatility, and forecasting results.
    Report Generation: Generating comprehensive reports that highlight market trends, price projections, volatility, and investment implications.

## Key Components
1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

    Historical market data for TSLA, SPY, and BND was processed to ensure it is in the proper format for analysis.
    This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and scaling it appropriately for feeding into the LSTM models.

2. Model and Forecasting

    Pre-trained LSTM models for TSLA, SPY, and BND were used to make future price predictions based on the last 30 days of data.
    The forecasts were made for a 10-day period into the future.

3. Market Trend Analysis

    For each asset (TSLA, SPY, and BND), the following analyses were performed:
        Trend Direction: Identified whether the trend was upward, downward, or neutral.
        Trend Magnitude: Calculated the strength of the trend.
        Volatility: Forecasted volatility was calculated to assess the risk involved in holding each asset.
        Price Projections: Forecasted the maximum and minimum price ranges for the next 10 days.
        Investment Implications: Suggested suitable investment strategies based on the trend analysis.

4. Report Generation

    After analyzing the trends, a detailed market report was generated for each asset (TSLA, SPY, and BND). The report included:
        A summary of the overall trend.
        Projected price range and volatility.
        Market opportunities and risks.
        Investment implications, highlighting whether the asset is suitable for long-term investment or if caution should be exercised due to potential risks.

5. Results and Insights

    For each asset, the trend was analyzed as being "downward," with a forecasted price range and volatility provided. The results suggested potential buying opportunities during price dips but also highlighted risks of limited price movement and the potential for significant drawdowns.
    These insights were used to inform investors about the current market conditions and guide long-term investment decisions.

6. Forecasted Data and Visualization

    Forecasted data for each asset (TSLA, SPY, and BND) was saved into CSV files, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.
    Visualizations were created to illustrate the forecasted trends and price projections, making it easier to understand the potential movements in the market.

## Summary of the Generated Reports for Each Asset

    TSLA (Tesla)
        Trend: Downward
        Forecasted Max Price: $5.38
        Forecasted Min Price: $2.30
        Volatility: 2.00%
        Investment Implication: Suitable for longer-term holding, with potential buying opportunities during dips.

    SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
        Trend: Downward
        Forecasted Max Price: $4.01
        Forecasted Min Price: $2.34
        Volatility: 1.72%
        Investment Implication: Suitable for longer-term holding, with stable price movement expected.

    BND (Bond ETF)
        Trend: Downward
        Forecasted Max Price: $4.57
        Forecasted Min Price: $3.08
        Volatility: 2.00%
        Investment Implication: Suitable for longer-term holding with moderate risk.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive market trend analysis and forecasting tool for financial assets like TSLA, SPY, and BND. The combination of machine learning models for forecasting and detailed trend analysis allows investors to make more informed decisions about their investments. By understanding the potential risks and rewards of holding these assets, investors can adjust their portfolios accordingly.

The generated reports and forecasts help investors identify suitable opportunities, plan for potential market risks, and better position themselves for future market conditions.
